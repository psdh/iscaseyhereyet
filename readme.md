# Is Casey here yet?

A small chrome extension to fetch Casey's latest video.
I often find myself wasting time on checking for his daily videos, a chrome extension will definitely make it quicker :)

### Installation
* As of now, it is not available on the store
* Clone this repository
* Move to developer mode on chrome (a checkbox in chrome://extensions)
* Add new extension and browse to the directory where you cloned this extension

### Future possibilities:
* allow for any possible youtube user
* allow notifications when the new video comes out
* push this to the store if people find this useful
